1.3.0
3D Character Sci-Fi Robots Bundle includes four full rigged humanoid robot characters for many purposes, including gamedev and animating. 

Origins of all models, armatures and prefabs are set to lower middle point for easy scaling. Visual appearance of characters can be modified through sprite repaint.

All characters are fully rigged and support animation. 
Note: Rigs don't support animations from Mixamo default armature set. For this purpose it is required to create a new armature on the website.

Models have high polygon count (46K-70K) and do not support LODs. Use them carefully.

The content is a subject to change in the future. Changes will depend on a feedback and creator's own desicions. To provide feedback leave a review on the Asset Store page.
